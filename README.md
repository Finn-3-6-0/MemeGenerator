## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview  
This meme generator fetches random images from **Unsplash**, then uses **Gemini AI** to generate a meme caption.  
It draws the captions onto the image using **Pillow**, and wraps text with **textwrap** for a cleaner, classic meme look.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This  
This was a fun way to:
- Practice integrating APIs into my programs
- Learn draawing text onto images with Pillow  
- Explore generative AI in a creative way

This project is part of a series of small projects I will be doing to help me learn Python, aswell as other technology in a way that is fun and engaing for me. In the future if i choose to expand on this project I would add more error handling for bad API requests, add more meme formats and try out different AI models to see which is the funniest :).
